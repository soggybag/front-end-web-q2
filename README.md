# Ideas

- Solution: Make School apps. Apps based on class projects with a final public form.

        - Students can contribute to the weather app. 
        - Analytics for weather requests (Micro-Service architecture)
    - Example: iOS UI Widgets 
        - Create new widgets 
        - Design widget presentation
        - Improve existing widgets
